**Help the rocket safely explore the unexplored depths of caves on Mars**

This is the spiritual successor to Project Boost but much more well realised and a bit more responsive 

There are a few bugs but they are not jarring or game breaking

The controls are that you can use the main thruster with the SpaceBar while the left and right thrusters that rotate the rocket can be accessed using A or D keys

*I implemented a lot more concepts and this games looks and feels cleaner than most of my previous projects*

## Thank You!
